title: Jelly no Puzzle extra levels
---

Jelly no Puzzle is a fantastic puzzle game by Qrostar, with a few versions. The [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jellycrew.jellynopuzzle&hl=en) is the best to get and has 70 levels, and the [Windows version](http://qrostar.skr.jp/en/jelly/) has the original 40 levels, a subset of the Android version. Qrostar also released 3 bonus levels which used to be hosted on his website but are no longer there, but he gave me permission to share them. [Here](joelthefox.github.io/jelly1000.zip) is a zip of the Windows version with a completed save file. The bonus levels are 38, 39, and 40, replacing the original levels of those numbers. The last of these is particularly nice (and hard, naturally). If you are a fan you might also be interested in [Jack no Puzzle](https://jackkutilek.itch.io/jack-no-puzzle), 10 fan-made levels by Jack Kutilek written in PuzzleScript. They are roughly the same difficulty as the original game.
