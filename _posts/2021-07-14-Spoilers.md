title: Spoilers Test

Hi Joel! I'm trying to make some spoilers right here:


<span class="spoiler spoilered">*this should be hidden*</span>


Now a larger one, with links (from the other article). Noticing that clicking on the links does nothing before the spoiler is revealed.

<span class="spoiler spoilered">
[Who Took All the Mud?](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ar8m4sxHoFLQgqkGLBJ8lNG8hrs4CA?e=7JLn93) is a 10 level puzzle pack for Dom Camus' [The Golem](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1270390/The_Golem/). The included ReadMe has information on the levels and how to play them in the editor. I don't recommend looking at these until you've mostly finished the original game, and unfortunately the editor only runs on Windows right now.

I also designed some less original levels that you can find on the [wiki](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/snakefall/wiki).

Finally, a tricky nested spoiler: <span class="spoiler spoilered">
(but this is not everything ?)  <span class="spoiler spoilered"> Just one more: <span class="spoiler spoilered"> that's it! </span></span>
</span>

 That's it! Enjoy ;)
