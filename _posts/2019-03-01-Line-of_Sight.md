title: Line of Sight
---

I made a puzzle game with [Mike Gelbart](https://www.mikegelbart.com/) called Line of Sight.  The theme is that certain objects called "towers" must see other towers in a straight, unobstructed line.  It's made in PuzzleScript, and is available [here](https://joel-fox.itch.io/line-of-sight) hosted on itch, where we implemented a level selector.  It should work on any browser, but does not seem to run well on mobile.  For anyone interested in the code, [here](https://www.puzzlescript.net/editor.html?hack=de1bcd042688497e6222c9bba414f33f) is a link to the PuzzleScript editor.
