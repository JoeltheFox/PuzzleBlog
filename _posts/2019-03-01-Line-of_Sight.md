I have designed a number of puzzles for other games, as well as two original games. I enjoy difficult puzzles and that is reflected in what you'll see below!

My puzzles for other games include:

[Temple](https://wolfesoftware.com/snakefall/#level=HyRr4JK1&20&40?*b1*A0*31*D0110*32*40111*70*3201102*102*I02*10201102022202*30*02*70202220201102024202*I0202420201100020002*401*902000200011000*12*30*02*70*1200011*Y0*01*W0*01*U0*21*U0*21*U0*21*U0*21*V0*11*202*O0*11*202*N0*212*102*N0*81222*410*510*j1/f25?325/f26?483/f27?526/f10?569/f0?652/s4?705/f8?670/f11?550/f6?220/f12?258/f1?196/f4?238/f2?665/b3?612/b4?625/f3?255/f5?138/), built in the Snakefall demake of [Snakebird](https://snakebird.noumenongames.com/). I also made some other less original levels that you can find on the [wiki](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/snakefall/wiki).  
A [fan-level](https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=e564118925b2fa677552548527fdeb7d) for Gate88's [Bubble Butler](https://gate.itch.io/bubble-butler).  
I made some contributions to Ali Nikkhah's masterpiece [Vertebrae](https://draxes.itch.io/vertebrae).  
The last level of [What Gophers Go For](https://what-gophers-go-for.github.io/).  
A [modified level 7](https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=2569c0d26a4331cffc7efaa9df88607c) of Jack Kutilek's [Snakehole](https://jackkutilek.itch.io/snakehole).  
A [desecration](https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=443f041b36f57539884e69d2df7bb212) of Jack Lance's [I'm Too Far Gone](https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=a4bb2bf44284bdb9347cf3f1399d4f11).  
A few small contributions to Andy Duff's Push Blox 2, including a variant of the last level (not yet released).  

A half-original game is my Weird Bug. The [original Weird Bug](https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=9174930) by Jonah Ostroff is an incomplete puzzle game that is a fun exerpiment for anyone who knows [PuzzleScript](https://www.puzzlescript.net/) or wants to learn. [My version](https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=17db830ed0a1d55310459de11ab1feff) is a complete game based on the original. I will soon add a level selector and put it on itch.io

What does this shiny gem do?

I made two puzzle games with [Mike Gelbart](https://www.mikegelbart.com/), Line of Sight and Herding Hero, both using the language [PuzzleScript](https://www.puzzlescript.net/).

[Herding Hero](https://joel-fox.itch.io/herding-hero) is our second game and I think the better of the two.  It's about being a herding dog and having to herd goats and sheep, who behave differently and all seem to start in difficult positions.  It's quite a challenging game throughout, but I hope that the levels provide enough variety to keep it enjoyable.  

![Herding Hero](https://joelthefox.github.io/img/herdingheroscreen.jpg "An early level of Herding Hero")  
Getting all the goats into the bottom left pen in this early level of Herding Hero is harder than it looks!

In [Line of Sight](https://joel-fox.itch.io/line-of-sight), movable *towers* are satisfied only if they see other towers in a straight, unobstructed line.  It's more of a sokoban-like game than Herding Hero, in that a lot of it is about pushing objects into the right positions, in the right sequence.  Unlike other sokoban games, the end state that you would like to achieve is not always clear (all towers might be satisfied in a number of possible arrangements), and will take some deduction.

![Line of Sight](https://joelthefox.github.io/img/LoSscreen.png "Level 3 of Line of Sight")  
The blue towers in this position are satisfied because they can see eachother vertically, while the one on the bottom is unsatisfied.

[PuzzleScript Robots](https://joel-fox.itch.io/puzzlescript-robots) is a small collection of puzzles based on the boardgame [Ricochet Robots](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/51/ricochet-robots) by Alex Randolph.  It has a move counter so that you can try to solve each level in the fewest possible moves.
