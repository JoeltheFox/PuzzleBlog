title: Jelly no Puzzle
---

Jelly no Puzzle is a brilliant puzzle game by Qrostar, which I highly recommend. The [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jellycrew.jellynopuzzle&hl=en) is the best to with 70 levels by the designer, and is fairly cheap (the first few levels are free as a demo). The [Windows version](http://qrostar.skr.jp/en/jelly/) has the original 40 levels, a subset of the Android version, and is free. 

Qrostar also released 3 bonus levels which were previously hosted on his website and are no longer there, but he gave me permission to share them. [Here](jelly1000.zip) is a zip of the Windows version including the bonus levels, with a completed save file so you can go straight to them. The bonus levels are 38, 39, and 40, replacing the original levels of those numbers. The last of these is particularly nice (and hard, naturally). If you are a fan you might also be interested in [Jack no Puzzle](https://jackkutilek.itch.io/jack-no-puzzle), 10 fan-made levels by Jack Kutilek written in PuzzleScript. They are roughly the same difficulty as the original game.
